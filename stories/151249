{"story": "Once upon a time, in San Francisco, there lived a person named Alex. Alex was born and raised in Los Angeles and even though they had moved to the city by the bay, their roots remained firmly planted in the golden state. Despite being busy with work and other responsibilities, Alex never lost their love for music, particularly pop songs that always put them in a good mood. When it came to food, nothing could beat a scoop of ice cream on a hot day. And, as a self-proclaimed physics enthusiast, Alex spent most of their free time studying the subject they loved the most. One day, while walking through the city, Alex's phone rang and it was an unknown number. When they answered, they were greeted by a friendly voice asking if they had a minute to talk about a new job opportunity in physics research. Without hesitation, Alex agreed and soon found themselves on their way to a new adventure in their favorite subject.", "person": "{\"current_city\": \"San Francisco\", \"birth_place\": \"Los Angeles\", \"phone\": \"+1-612-422-5887x365\", \"fav_music\": \"Pop\", \"fav_food\": \"Ice Cream\", \"fav_subject\": \"Physics\"}"}
