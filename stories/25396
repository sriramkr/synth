When she wasn't at work, she could often be found cruising around Los Angeles in her shiny BMW. One of her favorite things to do was indulge in a piping hot calzone from her favorite local pizzeria.\n\nWhen it came to music, this person had a particular taste for the fast-paced beats of techno. She loved to dance and move to the rhythm of her favorite tracks. Another thing she loved was basketball, and her favorite team was the San Antonio Spurs.
