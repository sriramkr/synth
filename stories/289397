{"story": "\nCarlos was born in 1956, in Brazil. Growing up, he was always fascinated by science and spent countless hours studying biology. However, his favorite pastime was not the usual quiet pursuits of a scientist. Carlos loved adrenaline sports, and nothing got him more excited than jumping off a cliff or racing through the jungle on his dirt bike.\n\nAs he grew older, Carlos' love for science and adventure only grew stronger. He spent hours reading about new discoveries in biology and thrilling tales of extreme sports. When he wasn't out exploring the wilderness, he could be found at home sipping on a tall glass of pineapple juice and watching horror movies late into the night.\n\nOne day, Carlos decided to combine his two favorite hobbies and went on a trip to the Amazon rainforest to study the unique flora and fauna there. As he trekked through the jungle, he couldn't resist the urge to test out some of the more dangerous sports, like zip-lining and white-water rafting.\n\nDespite the risks, Carlos loved every moment of it. He felt alive, invigorated by the rush of adrenaline that came with each new challenge. And as he returned home from his trip, he knew he had found his true calling. From then on, he dedicated himself to exploring the world's most extreme sports while studying and sharing his knowledge of biology with others.", "person": "{\"hobby\": \"Adrenaline sports\", \"language\": \"Portuguese\", \"birth_year\": \"1956\", \"fav_beverage\": \"Pineapple juice\", \"fav_movie\": \"Horror\", \"fav_subject\": \"Biology\"}"}
