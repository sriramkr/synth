Despite not being able to watch the games live, they enjoyed visiting the mall to catch up on the latest sports news and stay updated on their favorite team's performance.

However, they felt grateful for the opportunities that Los Angeles had provided them and the comfortable life they had built there.", "person": "{\"birth_year\": \"1957\", \"current_city\": \"Los Angeles\", \"birth_place\": \"Mumbai\", \"fav_soccer_team\": \"Real Madrid\", \"fav_location\": \"mall\"}"}
