{"story": "\nOnce upon a time, in Nashville, Tennessee, there was a music theorist named Colton McCann. He was known for his expertise in music theory and had many clients who came to him for advice on their compositions. Despite not being a football fan, Colton's favorite team was the Minnesota Vikings.\n\nColton loved spending his time at the mall, browsing through different shops and trying out new foods. He especially had a soft spot for peaches and would often visit the farmers' market in Nashville to get a taste of fresh peaches every summer.\n\nOne day, while out shopping at the mall, Colton received an email from his favorite football team, the Minnesota Vikings, inviting him to attend a game at U.S. Bank Stadium. Excited about the opportunity, Colton quickly replied to the email and made arrangements to attend the game.\n\nOn the day of the game, Colton arrived early at the stadium and was amazed by the energy and excitement in the air. He watched as the Vikings took the field and heard the roar of the crowd. Despite not being a big fan of football, Colton found himself completely immersed in the experience.\n\nThroughout the game, Colton enjoyed trying out different foods at the stadium, including hot dogs, pizza, and beer. He also loved watching the players make their way down the field, using his knowledge of music theory to analyze their movements and strategies.\n\nAs the game came to a close and the Vikings won, Colton felt a sense of pride and accomplishment. He had never been more excited about anything than this football game, and he knew that it was all thanks to his love of peaches and his passion for music theory.", "person": "{\"email\": \"coltonmccann@willis.com\", \"occupation\": \"music theorist\", \"birth_place\": \"Nashville\", \"fav_football_team\": \"Minnesota Vikings\", \"fav_location\": \"mall\", \"fav_food\": \"Peaches\"}"}
