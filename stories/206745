{"story": "\nOnce upon a time, there was a graphic designer named John who lived in Kolkata. Despite being surrounded by the vibrant city life, his heart belonged to Taiwan. John had always been fascinated by the beauty of the country and its rich culture.\n\nJohn's love for Taiwan extended beyond its landscapes and traditions, as he also had a soft spot for its food. Brownies were his go-to treat whenever he craved something sweet.\n\nOne day, while taking a stroll in Kolkata, John stumbled upon a post office. As he walked through the doors, he was immediately taken by the smell of freshly brewed tea. He couldn't resist the temptation and bought himself a cup of tea to enjoy on his way home.\n\nFrom that day forward, John made it a habit to visit the post office every morning for a cup of tea before starting his work as a graphic designer. He found solace in the simple act of sipping hot tea and watching the world go by.\n\nJohn's love for Taiwan continued to grow with each passing day, and he dreamed of one day visiting the country to explore its wonders firsthand. For now, he satisfied himself with browsing through travel books and photographs of his favorite locations in Taiwan.", "person": "{\"occupation\": \"Graphic designer\", \"current_city\": \"Kolkata\", \"fav_country\": \"Taiwan\", \"fav_food\": \"Brownies\", \"fav_location\": \"post office\", \"fav_beverage\": \"Tea\"}"}
