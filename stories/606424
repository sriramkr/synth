{"story": "\nAt Holland, a land surveyor by profession, loved to spend his evenings unwinding at the disco. His favorite subject was history and he would often find himself lost in the pages of old books, immersed in tales of ancient civilizations. When it came to drinks, Sauvignon Blanc was his go-to choice. With its crisp taste and refreshing bubbles, it perfectly complemented the lively atmosphere of the disco. Holland's colleagues at USNS Holland were always amazed by how he could switch between his technical work as a land surveyor to dancing the night away on the dance floor without missing a beat. Despite being stationed overseas, he never let his love for history and disco wane. Every chance he got, he would explore new places and learn about different cultures, always eager to expand his knowledge of the world's past. Holland was truly one of a kind - a land surveyor with a heart of gold and a passion for life that shone through in everything he did.", "person": "{\"occupation\": \"Land surveyor\", \"address\": \"USNS Holland, FPO AA 80605\", \"work_field\": \"Entertainment\", \"fav_location\": \"disco\", \"fav_subject\": \"History\", \"fav_beverage\": \"Sauvignon Blanc\"}"}
