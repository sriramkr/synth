As a fighter pilot, he spent most of his days in the cockpit, but when he had some free time, he would relax by listening to swing music on his phone. His favorite beverage was pilsner, which he would always have a cold one waiting for him at the end of a long day. Despite the dangers of his job, Jack always made sure to take care of himself and loved living life to the fullest. If you ever needed to reach him, you could give him a call at (466)515-9315x58248.", "person": "{\"car\": \"nissan\", \"occupation\": \"Fighter pilot\", \"phone\": \"(466)515-9315x58248\", \"fav_music\": \"Swing\", \"fav_beverage\": \"Pilsner\"}"}
