{"story": "\nOnce upon a time, there was a person born in Memphis, Tennessee. They grew up with a fascination for foreign languages and spent countless hours studying them. As they got older, they moved to San Jose, California where they continued their studies and eventually found work as a language teacher. Despite the hustle and bustle of city life, this person always made time for their favorite place to be, which was a cozy coffee shop nestled in the heart of the city. Here, they would spend hours sipping on lattes and practicing their languages with friends or students. And when it came to food, there was no question that lamb chops were their go-to dish. They loved the rich flavor and tender texture of the meat, often pairing it with a side of roasted vegetables for a satisfying meal.", "person": "{\"address\": \"9028 Isaiah Valley Suite 349\\nNew Sherry, NC 41909\", \"birth_place\": \"Memphis\", \"current_city\": \"San Jose\", \"fav_subject\": \"Foreign languages\", \"fav_location\": \"coffee shop\", \"fav_food\": \"Lamb Chops\"}"}
