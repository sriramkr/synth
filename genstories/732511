They would all gather around and share their love of Malbec, trying different types and pairing them with various foods. \nOne night, while listening to her favorite trance DJ play a live set, Sarah felt inspired to create her own Malbec-infused cocktail. She mixed together her favorite wine with a splash of citrus and a hint of spice, and the result was amazing. \nFrom that day on, Sarah's Malbec-trance combination became legendary among her friends. They would all gather around to taste her newest creations and discuss their favorite songs. \nSarah's love for Malbec and trance only grew with time.
