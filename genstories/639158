Whenever he had some free time, he would head down to the local basketball court to shoot some hoops and practice his skills.\n\nOne morning, Jake woke up feeling particularly tired and groggy. He knew he needed a pick-me-up, so he decided to brew himself a cup of coffee. As he waited for the water to boil, he listened to a radio broadcast of the Timberwolves' latest game.\n\nJake loved nothing more than sipping on his hot coffee while watching the Timberwolves play. He would often stay up late into the night, cheering them on as they battled their rivals.
