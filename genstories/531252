Every weekend, she would visit the local donut shop to indulge in her favorite treat. One day, while enjoying her donut, she heard a Christian Rock Ska song playing in the background. It instantly caught her attention and she started tapping her feet to the rhythm. From that moment on, Maria made it a point to listen to Christian Rock Ska music whenever she ate donuts.
