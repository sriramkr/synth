Growing up in the 80s, he would often listen to his favorite artists like Bob Marley and Peter Tosh while riding his bike around town. Jamal's love for reggae only grew stronger as he got older and he even started collecting vinyl records of some of his favorite songs.\n\nAside from his love for music, Jamal also had a soft spot for casserole. He remembered the delicious smell of his grandmother's homemade chicken pot pie filling the house on Sunday nights when he was a child. Whenever Jamal would visit her, she would always make sure to have a casserole dish ready for him.\n\nOne day, Jamal decided to combine his two favorite things and throw a reggae-themed casserole party. He invited all of his friends over and played some of his favorite songs while everyone enjoyed the delicious food. It was such a hit that Jamal started throwing these parties every month and they quickly became the highlight of everyone's summer.\n\nJamal would always make sure to have all the fixings for casserole, including his homemade reggae sauce which he would mix with the chicken and vegetables before baking them in a casserole dish. His friends loved it so much that they even started asking him for the recipe so they could make their own version at home.\n\nYears later, Jamal still had a soft spot for reggae music and casserole food. He would often reminisce about the good old days and how much he enjoyed combining these two things to create something special. Whenever he would visit his grandmother, he would always make sure to ask her for the recipe for her famous chicken pot pie so he could keep the tradition alive.", "person": "{\"fav_music\": \"Reggae\", \"fav_food\": \"Casserole\"}"}
