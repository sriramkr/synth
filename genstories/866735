On Sundays, however, Alex would trade their love of reading for their love of football, and they would always make sure to catch the Dallas Cowboys game. Whether it was at home with friends or at a sports bar, Alex would be glued to the TV, cheering on their favorite team.

In this way, Alex felt like they had found the perfect balance in life, where they could indulge in both of their favorite pastimes.", "person": "{\"fav_location\": \"library\", \"fav_football_team\": \"Dallas Cowboys\"}"}
