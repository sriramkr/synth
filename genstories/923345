Growing up in Florida, he had always been an avid sports fan and was particularly fond of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He would often combine his love for music and football by attending live games with friends while singing along to their favorite folk songs. Mark's passion for both music and sports only grew stronger as he got older, and he even began playing the guitar and singing in a local folk band. Despite his busy schedule, Mark always made time to attend Buccaneers games and sing along with the crowd, making memories that would last him a lifetime.", "person": "{\"fav_music\": \"Folk\", \"fav_football_team\": \"Tampa Bay Buccaneers\"}"}
