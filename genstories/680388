{"story": "\nOnce upon a time, there was a person named Sarah who lived in Dallas. Her favorite pastime was watching football and her go-to team was the Dallas Cowboys. Every game day, she would put on her Cowboys jersey and cheer loudly as they played. When she wasn't watching football, Sarah loved to spend her time at the mall. She would stroll through the different stores, people watch, and indulge in some retail therapy. The hustle and bustle of the mall always put her in a good mood. Sometimes, she would even meet up with friends for a shopping excursion. Despite her love for the mall, Sarah always made sure to catch a Cowboys game whenever they were playing. She considered herself a true fan and couldn't imagine supporting any other team.", "person": "{\"fav_football_team\": \"Dallas Cowboys\", \"fav_location\": \"mall\"}"}
