{"story": "Once upon a time, there was a person named Emily. She had a sweet tooth and her favorite food was bagel with cream cheese and lox. For beverages, she loved nothing more than a cold glass of Coke. Every morning, she would start her day off right by enjoying a warm bagel and a refreshing Coke. Whenever she went out for breakfast, she always made sure to find a place that served her favorite bagels. On weekends, Emily would often have brunch at home with her friends, where they'd enjoy bagels together along with their favorite drinks - for Emily, it was always Coke. Despite her love for sweet treats, Emily also had a healthy side and would often pair her bagels with fruits or veggies. Sometimes, when she wanted to indulge, she would have a double bagel with extra cream cheese and lox. No matter what, Emily's favorite combination of a bagel with Coke never failed to make her happy.", "person": "{\"fav_food\": \"Bagel\", \"fav_beverage\": \"Coke\"}"}
