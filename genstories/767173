{"story": "Once upon a time, there was a person named Tom who loved nothing more than the taste of juicy turkey. Whether it was Thanksgiving or any other time of the year, he would always make sure to include turkey in his meals. His love for this bird went so far that he even took up hunting as a hobby just so he could catch and cook his own turkeys. \n\nWhen it came to music, Tom had quite an eclectic taste. But there was one genre that stood out above the rest - funk. He would often dance around his kitchen while cooking, blasting his favorite funk tunes and getting lost in the beat. It was a great way for him to unwind after a long day at work. \n\nOne weekend, Tom decided to host a dinner party at his home. He knew that his guests would love the food, so he spent all morning preparing a big turkey feast. As everyone sat down to eat, he proudly presented his creation - a delicious roasted turkey with all the fixings. Everyone dug in and raved about how delicious it was. \n\nAs the dinner party went on, Tom realized that he had forgotten to play any music. But that was okay, because everyone was having so much fun talking and laughing that they didn't even notice. They were too busy enjoying each other's company. \n\nJust as they were finishing up dessert, Tom remembered that he had brought his funk music with him. He quickly plugged in his phone and started playing some of his favorite tunes. Everyone began to dance around the living room, getting lost in the beat of the music. They laughed and joked, enjoying each other's company even more now that they were dancing together. \n\nTom was thrilled to see how much everyone was enjoying themselves. He knew that he had found the perfect way to bring people together - good food and fun music. From then on, every dinner party he hosted included both of these elements, and everyone left with a smile on their face.", "person": "{\"fav_food\": \"Turkey\", \"fav_music\": \"Funk\"}"}
